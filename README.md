Sensors

## Install
To use this, install it through the package manager.

This also requires you to install my unity utils package found [here](https://github.com/dropecho/unity_utils)  
```git@github.com:dropecho/unity_utils.git```

You can click on the code button in the top right, copy that or just copy this 
```git@github.com:dropecho/unity_sensors.git```
