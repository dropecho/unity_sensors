Sensors

## Heads up

This is "beta ish" so if it does weird stuff (or the utils package does), just remove them and you should be back to original state and create an issue here.

## Install
To use this, install it through the package manager.


This also requires you to install my unity utils package found [here](https://github.com/dropecho/unity_utils)  
```git@github.com:dropecho/unity_utils.git```

You can click on the code button in the top right here on github, copy that or just copy this   
```git@github.com:dropecho/unity_sensors.git```

Install in unity via this:
